# GraduationProject-StatistiPark
This is a graduation project of my BSc in Software Engineering. The aim of the project is to create a system capable of predicting the time it would take for a parking spot to be available in a full parking lot. The system creates a statistical model of the parking lot and calculates the odds. In addition, it maps the current status of all spots in the parking lot, and generates various statistical reports.
